# 401k Match Maximizer

---

Small CLI utility to help calculate total contributions, total match amount, and contribution per pay period. Allows "optimizing", i.e., first maximize company match and then frontload contributions toward earlier pay periods.

See help documentation for usage:

```
$ python3 -m match_maximizer --help
```

## TODO

-   read through [distributing python packages](https://docs.python.org/3/distributing/index.html#distributing-index)
-   test that it can be installed using `$ pip install .`
